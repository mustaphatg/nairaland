## Nairaland Frontend
<img src="https://github.com/mustaphatg/nairaland/blob/main/Nairalnd%20-%20Github.png" >

A Reactjs web application that scrapes and  displays the content of https://nairaland.com ( the most popular web forum in Africa) in a nice ui designed with Material ui.


## How I scraped the data
Scraping the data was not an easy task. Nairaland is the most popular web forum in Africa and as a result of this, they made their layout using the table tag of HTML. This approach made it difficult to write a scraping script that will sort and extract the content from the forum . PHP/Laravel was later used to scrape the content and develop the api that the front-end component consumes. The laravel script can be found at https://github.com/mustaphatg/nairaland-backend.
